# ![](docs/img/house.png) Inigo - CityEngine Rule Package for Vitruvio

*Binaries are available at https://github.com/amybam/Inigo*

Inigo is a rule package for [Vitruvio](https://community.esri.com/docs/DOC-14445-vitruvio-cityengine-plugin-for-unreal-engine-4), [Palladio](https://esri.github.io/palladio) and [Serlio](https://esri.github.io/serlio) developed in collaboration with Project W.R.E.N. from Epic Games and Cornell University, led by Henry Richardson.  It enables the creation of detailed building environments in both CityEngine and Unreal Engine (enabled by the Vitruvio) for procedural context design in architecture and urban planning environments.

Inigo is well suited for creating detailed city environments for contextual development in architecture or urban planning, particulary in education environments. Like the plugins themselves, "[Inigo] is restricted to the procedural generation of single buildings / objects. [Inigo] does not include the city layouting and street network editing tools of CityEngine i.e. the rich CityEngine toolset to design a city from scratch (or based on geographic data) is still needed" (from Palladio Github readme)

*Inigo is free for non-commercial use.* Commercial use requires at least one commercial license of the latest CityEngine version installed in the organization. No redistribution is allowed.
