# Research Initialization

## Overview

### Stated Work Program

> Will continue developing CityEngine rule packages (RPKs) for use in both Rhino and Unreal Engine 4 using the VPVR's Wren Plugin.  He will also review ESRI's Vitruvio plugin based on our WREN plugin to areas of overlap and ways to short circuit some of the RPK work his is currently doing with the WREN plugin.

### Problems

- How can programmed urban situations allow for contextual rapid prototyping?
- How does Vitruvio compare to Wren Plugin?
- What is the best use case of either Vitruvio/Wren Plugin in relation to specific CGA?
- How do we mirror work done through the CGA in Rhinoceros?

### Process

Research should start with full understanding of the new materials provided since the start of last research, principally Vitruvio.  Using this knowledge and taking prior research into account, create a research roadmap that lays out the goals and ways of measuring process for the term.  

Looking at the research holistically, a state of completion is reached by attacking the problems from multiple angles.  Principally, the CGA has to be developed fully with a sample facade package and documentation that makes expansion simple.  Secondly, the CGA file should be mirrored into Rhino so that work can be done in either CityEngine or Rhinoceros.  Finally, an interface for Vitruvio for this specific use case should be developed creating a concrete workflow.

These overarching goals can be broken down further into individual tasks that can be used to track progress over the research term.  This can be seen in the Roadmap section below.

### Roadmap

The Roadmap is an ever evolving work tracker that maintains the same overarching goals as mentioned above, but addresses the smaller tasks that make up the weekly deliverables.  Additionally it allows me to track bugs that  may occur in the software design process. There are multiple ways of viewing the cards as seen on the top left and a tree of 'epics' and their respective 'tasks' can be traced. 

### Publication of Work

Work will be constantly updated on my GitHub page and will be published alongside rigorous documentation allowing future additions to the project.
